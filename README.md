## Project Overview:

In this project, I plan to develop a microservice using ASP.NET Core with the goal of gaining a comprehensive understanding of microservices architecture. By mastering these concepts, I aim to effectively apply this knowledge to future projects.

This is an e-commerce system built on microservice architecture using:

- .NET 8
- Entity Framework Core
- MediatR
- FastEndpoints
- Carter
- Yarp
- JWT Tokens
- MasTransit(Rabbitmq and Kafka)
- Polly
- NEST (ElasticSearch client)
- Dapper
- SignalR
- Clean Architecture
- DDD (Domain Driven Design)
- Vertical Slice Architecture
- Distributed Cache(Redis)
- MongoDb
- Postgresql
